This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside its valid index range. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code. This is a simple but crucial error to understand when working with arrays in any programming language.  Proper array boundary checking prevents unexpected program crashes and data corruption.
